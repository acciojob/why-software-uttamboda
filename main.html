	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>

    <p>
        I want to become a software developer because I have a deep passion for solving problems and creating innovative solutions. 
        The field of software development allows me to combine my creativity with logic to build tools and applications that can have a positive impact on people's lives. 
        Additionally, the tech industry is constantly evolving, which means there's always something new to learn, and that continuous growth excites me. 
        Being a developer also offers the opportunity to work on diverse projects, collaborate with talented people, and contribute to the digital transformation that shapes our world.
